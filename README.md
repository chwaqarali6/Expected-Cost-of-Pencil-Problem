# Expected-Cost-of-Pencil-Problem
You need to buy new pencils in every semester during your studies at the university. So, you need to have a budget plan for your pencils. But it is difficult to estimate the cost of a pencil after a year because the prices of pencil rise every year. You cannot simply use this yearâ€™s price as the price of pencil two years from now. The cost is likely to be higher than it is today. You need to write a program to calculate the expected cost of a pencil in a specified numbers of years. The program asks for the current cost of the pencil, the numbers of years from now that the pencil will be purchased, and the rate of increase in prices. The program then outputs the estimated cost of the item after the specified period.  For example, if the cost of a pencil is 2 rupees and the rate of increase in prices is 5% then the cost of the pencil in next years will be 2.1 where 0.1 is the added cost i.e. 5% of 2 rupees. Again, in the next year the cost will be 2.205.
